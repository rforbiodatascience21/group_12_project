## Agenda

* Introduction
  + Sampling
  + Dataset - prior to cleaning
* Materials and methods
  + From raw data to results
* Results
  + Precision of taxonomic classification
  + Community composition
  + Alpha diversity
  + Beta diversity
* Discussion

## Introduction

- **Dataset:** OTU table

- **Source:** *Effects of industrial effluents containing moderate levels of antibiotic mixtures on the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and bacterial community composition in exposed creek sediments*; Milakovic et.al, 2019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719359972 

- **Sequencing method:** Illumina-based 16S amplicon sequencing

- **Sampling location:** Kalinivica creek, Croatia. By antibiotic production facility wastewater outlet

- **Our aim:** Evaluate effect of wastewater discharge from antibiotic factory on bacterial community composition

## Sampling
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

```

## Dataset - prior to cleaning
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/figures/04_model_table.png")
```

## Flowchart: From raw data to results
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

```

## Precision of taxonomic classification
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/figures/05_na_barplot.png")
```

## Community composition by phyla
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/figures/06_abundance_season.png")
```

## Community composition by phyla 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/figures/06_abundance_location.png")
```


## Alpha diversity
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/figures/07_alpha_div.png")
```


## Beta diversity
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

```


## Discussion - Wastewater samples
* **Wastewater samples are different from other samples both on diversity and composition**
  + Wastewater as an environmental sample differs in physical properties compared to sediment samples
  + Wastewater samples are more a snapshot, due to water flow
  + Could possibly exclude wastewater samples

## Discussion - Effects on community composition
* **Location has more impact on diversity and composition**
  + **NMDS:** mainly clustering based on location
  + **NMDS:** less clustering based on sampling season
* **Downstream communities are the most diverse**
  + Many species are able to survive the high concentrations of antibiotics
  + Literature suggests that selective pressure from antibiotics can increase diversity (*Bengtsson-Palme et al., 2019*)
  + Different environment downstream (forest) than upstream (agricultural)
